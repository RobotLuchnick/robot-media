This is just a docker file to bring up my media management systems.  There's nothing novel or wise to be gotten here but it's a fun way to learn about Docker and GitHub.
It's probaly incredibly unwise that upon every commit Jellyfin gets restarted in my environment.  

I suppose I ought to branch this to development for my makeshift hyper-v environment setup a dedicated production dockerhost and tie that to the master branch.

Oh know!!!!1 it's going to to reload jellyfin again when I commit this! ðŸ˜†
